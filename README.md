# freeCodeCamp JS Calculator (ver. 3)

This is the third version I've made of a simple calculator in JavaScript/jQuery, CSS & HTML as one of the final projects to freeCodeCamp's frontend development program. It has been a pain in the butt however, with each rebuild it has gotten better and I've learned more from this project than many of the others.
